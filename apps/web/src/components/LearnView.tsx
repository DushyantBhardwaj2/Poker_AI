      chapter: 1,
      title: "Beyond Beginning Poker",
      icon: Combine,
      theory: "At its core, poker is a game of skill—specifically, the skill of minimizing losses on bad hands and maximizing profits on good hands. You are constantly at war with luck.",
      key_point: "The goal is not to win individual pots, but to make money by consistently making decisions with positive mathematical expectation.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-1"
    },
    {
      chapter: 2,
      title: "Expectation and Hourly Rate",
      icon: Target,
      theory: "Mathematical expectation is the foundation of all gambling. It defines the average amount you stand to win or lose per bet over the long run.",
      key_point: "The sum of all your expectations forms your hourly rate. Focus on making +EV decisions and ignoring short-term results.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-2"
    },
    {
      chapter: 3,
      title: "The Fundamental Theorem of Poker",
      icon: Users,
      theory: "You profit whenever an opponent plays their hand differently from how they would have played it if they could see your cards. You lose when you do the same.",
      key_point: "The goal is to make decisions that are +EV against your opponent's range, forcing them into theoretical mistakes.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-3"
    },
    {
      chapter: 6,
      title: "Effective Odds",
      icon: Calculator,
      theory: "Immediate pot odds can be misleading when multiple betting rounds remain. Effective odds factor in the cost of all future bets you will have to call.",
      key_point: "Generally, future betting rounds reduce the appeal of drawing hands. Always consider the total price of seeing the river.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-6"
    },
    {
      chapter: 8,
      title: "The Value of Deception",
      icon: ZoomIn,
      theory: "Straightforward play allows observant opponents to play perfectly against you. Deception disguises your strength to force opponents into making mistakes.",
      key_point: "Weigh the cost of being outdrawn against the benefit of a future payoff. Use deception primarily against 'super readers'.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-8"
    },
    {
      chapter: 11,
      title: "The Semi-Bluff",
      icon: Repeat,
      theory: "A semi-bluff is a bet with a hand that is likely not the best right now but has a good chance of becoming the best. It combines fold equity and showdown equity.",
      key_point: "Two ways to win: everyone folds immediately, or you hit your draw and win at showdown.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-11"
    },
    {
      chapter: 13,
      title: "Raising",
      icon: ArrowUpCircle,
      theory: "Never raise 'just to see where you are.' Raise to: 1) Increase the pot (Value), 2) Drive out opponents (Protection), 3) Bluff, or 4) Get a free card.",
      key_point: "Every raise must have a clear strategic purpose beyond gathering information.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-13"
    },
    {
      chapter: 14,
      title: "Check-Raising",
      icon: MousePointer2,
      theory: "Check-raising is checking with the intention of raising after an opponent bets. It's a powerful tool to trap opponents or protect a hand when out of position.",
      key_point: "Use check-raising to exploit aggressive bettors and to make checking less of a sign of weakness.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-14"
    },
    {
      chapter: 15,
      title: "Slowplaying",
      icon: Ghost,
      theory: "Slowplaying is checking or just calling with a very strong hand to induce opponents to bet or to keep them in the pot when they might otherwise fold.",
      key_point: "Slow-play only when you have a monster, the board is 'dry', and you expect an aggressive opponent to bet for you.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-15"
    },
    {
      chapter: 17,
      title: "Position",
      icon: Layout,
      theory: "Position refers to where you sit relative to the dealer button. Being in late position allows you to see how everyone else acts before you make a decision.",
      key_point: "Acting last is the single greatest advantage in poker. Play more hands, more aggressively, when in position.",
      href: "/theory/chapter-17"
